# mt-mods organization

## Community

* IRC: #mt-mods / #mt-mods-offtopic
* Discord: https://discord.gg/8k3K5nyj7x

## TODO

(just dumping my ideas here for now)

* Create guidelines (not rules)
  * `mt-mods` should be a place for innovation not a mod-graveyard
  * Clarify the "unofficial" position (not endorsed by the "official" community, whatever official means)
  * Mod development
    * Backwards compatibility
  * Modding/coding should be fun
* Chat
  * Bridge discord <-> irc channels
  * Add all gh-webhooks to the discord feed (commits, issues, pr's)
* Find out where to place the `awesome-minetest` repo
